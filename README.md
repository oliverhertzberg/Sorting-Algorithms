# Sorting Algorithms Repository
Welcome to the Sorting Algorithms Repository! This repository is a collection of various sorting algorithms implemented in C. The source code of each algorithm is organized into its respective folder. Some information on each algorithm below.

## Insertion Sort
## +
1. Simple implementation (easy to understand)
2. In-place sorting (no additional memory required for temporary storage)
3. Efficient for small data sets or nearly sorted data
4. Stable sorting algorithm, meaning it maintains the relative order of equal elements in the input array.
## -
1. Inefficient against more extensive data sets.
2. Worst-case time complexity: O(n^2).
3. Slower than other more advanced algorithms.

## Bubble Sort
## +
1. Easy to understand and implement.
2. In-place sorting.
3. Performs well when array is almost sorted.
## -
1. Worst-case time complexity: O(n^2).
2. Does more element assignments than its counterpart, insertion sort.

## Selection Sort
## +
1. Simple and easy to understand and implement.
2. Efficient for small data sets or nearly sorted data.
3. In-place sorting.
# -
1. Inefficient for large data sets.
2. Worst-cast time complexity: O(n^2).
3. Non-stable, swaps non-adjacent elements.
4. A lot of comparisons.

## Merge Sort
## +
1. Can efficiently sort a list in O(n*log(n)) time.
2. Optimal for linked lists.
3. No worst-case scenario.
4. Stable sorting algorithm. (preserves order of equal elements)
## -
1. Slow for small datasets.
2. The same runtime for already sorted arrays.

## Quick Sort
## +
1. Fast and easy to implement
2. In-place
## -
1. Unstable
2. Dependant on the choice of the pivot
3. Less suitable for linked lists
